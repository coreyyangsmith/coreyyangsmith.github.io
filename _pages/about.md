🚀 **About Me**

I'm an AI Team Lead at Urban Systems Ltd., where I specialize in bridging cutting-edge artificial intelligence with the real-world needs of civil engineering, construction, and public engagement. I turn emerging research into practical tools that drive measurable business impact—whether that’s streamlining operations, accelerating design, or enhancing decision-making.

🔍 Currently, I’m completing my PhD in Software Engineering at the University of Calgary, where I focus on automating software development workflows using LLMs. I’m deeply passionate about AI, especially in the areas of LLMs, generative AI, and multi-agent systems.

🏆 Career Highlights
