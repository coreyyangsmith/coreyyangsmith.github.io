𝗚𝗼𝗹𝗱𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘁 is a 𝗳𝘂𝗹𝗹-𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝘄𝗲𝗯-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 finance and budgeting application built with 𝗗𝗷𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗼 and 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 (MUI). I led the entire design process using 𝗙𝗶𝗴𝗺𝗮, implemented secure user authentication with 𝗝𝗪𝗧, and encrypted sensitive financial data to ensure privacy. Users can create customizable budget categories and subcategories, set spending limits, and visualize their financial activity through interactive charts powered by various JavaScript libraries. For enhanced visual appeal, select UI elements feature 3D effects using 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲.𝗷𝘀 (𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗿𝗲𝗲 𝗙𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿).
